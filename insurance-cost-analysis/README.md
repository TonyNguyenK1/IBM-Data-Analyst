# Insurance Cost Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of insurance costs to uncover trends and relationships between various factors such as age, BMI, region, and smoking status. The goal is to gain insights into the factors influencing insurance costs and explore potential predictive modeling.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualizations and statistical summaries to identify trends in insurance costs.
  - Correlation analysis to understand relationships between features.

- **Insights and Trends**:
  - Highlights significant variables affecting insurance costs.
  - Analyzes patterns like the impact of smoking or age on charges.

- **Model Development**:
  - Implements machine learning or regression techniques to predict insurance costs.

## Data Analysis Process

1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Examines the distribution of variables such as age, BMI, region, and charges.
   - Identifies missing or unusual values for cleaning.

2. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Calculates correlations and tests for relationships between variables.

3. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Trains machine learning models or regression to predict insurance costs based on input features.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
