# Model Development: Laptop Price Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on building predictive models to estimate laptop prices based on key features. The analysis involves exploring data and implementing machine learning techniques to create an accurate model.

## Features

- **Data Preparation**:
  - Preprocesses the dataset for model development.
  - Handles missing values and performs feature engineering.

- **Model Development**:
  - Implements machine learning models to predict laptop prices.
  - Evaluates models based on performance metrics.

- **Insights**:
  - Identifies features most influential in predicting laptop prices.

## Data Analysis Process

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Understands the relationship between features and price.
   - Performs visualizations for feature importance.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Develops models such as linear regression, decision trees, or other advanced techniques.
   - Compares models based on metrics like RÂ² and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Handles categorical and numerical data for improved model performance.
   - Scales features and encodes categorical variables.
